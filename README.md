# SQL-Mock-Pharmacy-Expense-Report
This is a mock up expense table of a Pharmacy company that was created in SQL. 

In this scenario, The Pharmacy company wants me to work on an expense report for the year 2023. They want me to look at the following:
1) The expenses by category (ex: entertainment, travel, supplies)
2) Calculate the expenses by month
3) Calculate the Expense by the source of the expense (ex: suppliers, restaurants, travel methods)
4) Expenses of the company salaries by career department

In conclusion, I created the tables with the raw data and then combined them to get the results mentioned previously. Then created visuals using tableau. The results showed the following:
The top 3 expense categories were Salary, Supplies and Entertainment. 
The highest expense was in the month of April due to the yearly lease, medical supplies and salary. The average monthly expense is 41,203.
The highest expense source company was PillCorp which is the primary supplier 
The salary expenses by career department was close to even but the highest expense was the Production department.



In this project you can find the SQL code(query(21).sql), the CSV tables that were exported from SQL, and the visual dashboard png files.
