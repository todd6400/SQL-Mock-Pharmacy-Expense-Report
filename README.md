# SQL-Mock-Pharmacy-Expense-Report
This is a mock up expense table of a Pharmacy company that was created in SQL. 

In this scenario, The Pharmacy company wants me to work on an expense report for the year 2023. They want me to look at the following:
1) The expenses by category (ex: entertainment, travel, supplies)
2) Calculate the expenses by month
3) Calculate the Expense by the source of the expense (ex: suppliers, restaurants, travel methods)
4) Expenses of the company salaries by career department

In conclusion, I created the tables with the raw data and then combined them to get the results mentioned previously. Then created visuals using tableau.

In this project you can find the SQL code, the CSV tables that were exported from SQL, and the visual dashboard png files.
